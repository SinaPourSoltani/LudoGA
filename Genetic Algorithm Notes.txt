Genetic Algorithm Notes

Fitness:
	Number of wins out of 30 games
	Add points for sending opponents home
	Add points for getting pieces out
	Total of piece positions relative to opponentsâ€™
	Incentivise higher indices early (getting ahead faster

Normalised fitness
Roulette selection
	Pick random individuals from population (pop until all individuals have mated)
Two point crossover


Hyperparameters:
Crossover rate
Mutation rate
Selection type (roulette / ranked)
ANN:	
	Number of hidden layers
	Number of nodes in layers
Weight resolution (bits per weight)

What to plot

Parameter control:
	Mutation
	Two-point Crossover
	Ranked

Save wins and fitness of each individual
	Boxplot per generation
	100 generations

Comparisons:
	Linear transition (reduced state)
	ANN (reduced state)
	ANN (positions state)
